## Ideas

### WhereWeGoin.io

**Description:** A user tells us a City they plan on traveling to and the time of year they plan on going. We then use this information coupled with the user’s profile to help recommend attractions and things to do for the user on their preferences. We will need to pull in 2 datasets, one for the weather data (OpenWeatherMap, Accuweather, etc..) and the other for the location/tourist activity data(TripAdvisor, etc…).  We will use a database to store user account information and data about the user to make better recommendations (such as their preferences and things they like to do, age, and what not potentially). We will also allow the user to give us their (discord channel/email address/ twitter) so that we can send messages to them to alert them of the trip, this will satisfy the third requirement.

### Travelcheap

**Description:** A travel app. Users give us their budget, and the part of the world they would like to travel to. We will then use the TripAdvisor API (https://developer-tripadvisor.com/content-api/) combined with a currency converter API (https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/) to return to them the best possible deal. We use this combined information to recommend them travel packages. Essentially, we try to streamline the process of finding cheap travel and show people where they can travel for the best bang for their buck. We will use a database to store user accounts and (Facebook/Twitter/whateverOAuth one of us knows how to use) to satisfy the third requirement.
Say what the step will be
